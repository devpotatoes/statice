Statice is a time-tracking extension for Visual Studio Code to explore your stats and boost your productivity. Join our community of developers who use Statice to study and manage their stats.

## Track Development Metrics

Discover insights into your coding habits to gauge your progression.

Hover the Statice button on the status bar and it will display in real-time how many hours and minutes you code each day.

For a comprehensive view of your coding and project statistics, open the Statice panel by clicking on the Statice icon in your sidebar. Then click on the Dashboard button to launch a detailed dashboard within a new editor window. This dashboard compiles essential coding metrics including total coding duration, daily coding duration, week streaks, the most popular languages, and your progress.

> [!NOTE]
> Time spent on Visual Studio Code is counted even if you are inactive!

* `Total Code Time Module`: Displays total time spent on Visual Studio Code. You can also see the progression of your total time over the last 7 days.

* `Daily Code Time Module`: Displays total time spent on Visual Studio Code today or on the date specified in the date input. You can also see the progression compared to the average time you spend every day.

* `Week Streaks`: Display the time you spent this week and last week, code every day for a full week and increase your score. (If you stop one day, the score goes back to 0)

> [!TIP]
> How `Week Streaks` are calculated?
> Lvl 1: 1min, Lvl 2: 1h, Lvl 3: 3h, Lvl 4: 5h, Lvl 5: 8h.

* `Graphic Code Time Module`: Display the time you spent every day this week or on the interval specified in the date input. (Hover the points on the curve to display precise values and days)

* `Bar chart`: The first part displays the most frequently used languages and expresses the time spent as a % of total time. The second part shows the projects you work on most and expresses the time spent as a % of total time.

## Safe, Secure, and Free

Statice doesn't collect any data, least of all what you program. For statistical purposes, Statice retrieves the extension of files you're in, as well as the name of open projects. This extension stores all data locally on your PC and never communicates with a server.

## Extension Settings

Statice offers a direct interface for managing the extension's settings, as well as the possibility of changing the theme and resetting its stats.

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `statice.theme`: Change extension dashboard theme. (Auto is adapted to your editor's theme)
* `statice.notifications`: Enable/disable all the notifications that do not display an error or important information.

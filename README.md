- `Total code time module`: Displays total time spent on Visual Studio Code.

- `Today code time module`: Displays your coding time today and compares to your average daily coding time over your last 30 active days. 

    This helps you track how consistently you’re coding day‑to‑day, aim for around 100% or more each day to build and maintain a steady habit.

> [!NOTE]
> An active day refers to any day during which coding activity was tracked.

- `Week streaks module`: The Week Streaks module tracks your consistency over time. A week streak is completed when you log at least one active day for every day in a given week.

    The current week is visually represented, with each day shown as a colored cell, the brighter or more intense the color, the more time you spent coding that day. 

    Next to the graph, you’ll also see your total number of week streaks achieved compared to the total number of weeks in the current year, helping you gauge your long-term consistency.

- `Graphic code time module`: Visualize the time you spent every day this week or on the interval specified on the calendar. Hover the points on the curve to display precise values and days.

- `Bar chart modules`: The first chart highlights your most frequently used programming languages, showing the proportion of time spent on each as a percentage of your total coding time.

    The second chart showcases the projects you've worked on the most, also represented as a percentage of your overall coding activity.
